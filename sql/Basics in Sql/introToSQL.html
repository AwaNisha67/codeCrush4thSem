    <h1>Introduction to SQL:-</h1>
    <hr>
     <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a computer language that we use to interact with a relational database. SQL is a tool for organizing, managing, and retrieving archived data from a computer database. The original name was given by IBM as Structured English Query Language, abbreviated by the acronym SEQUEL. When data needs to be retrieved from a database, SQL is used to make the request. The DBMS processes the SQL query retrieves the requested data and returns it to us. Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data should be organized or what data should be extracted or added to the database.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>What are the characteristics of SQL?</h2>
     <ul>
     <li value="1">SQL may be utilized by quite a number of users, which include people with very little programming experience.</li>
     <li value="2">SQL is a non-procedural language.&nbsp;</li>
     <li value="3">We can without difficulty create and replace databases in SQL. It isn&#8217;t a time-consuming process.&nbsp;</li>
     <li value="4">SQL is primarily based totally on ANSI standards.&nbsp;</li>
     <li value="5">SQL does now no longer have a continuation individual.</li>
     <li value="6">SQL is entered into the SQL buffer on one or more lines.&nbsp;</li>
     <li value="7">SQL makes use of a termination individual to execute instructions immediately. It makes use of features to carry out a few formatting.</li>
     <li value="8">It uses functions to perform some formatting.&nbsp;</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="uses-of-sql">Uses of SQL </h2>
     <ol>
     <li value="1"><b><strong>Data definition:</strong></b> It is used to define the structure and organization of the stored&nbsp;data and the relationships among the stored data items.</li>
     <li value="2"><b><strong>Data retrieval:</strong></b>&nbsp;SQL can also be used for data retrieval.</li>
     <li value="3"><b><strong>Data manipulation: </strong></b>If the user wants to add new data, remove data, or modifying in existing data then SQL provides this facility also.</li>
     <li value="4"><b><strong>Access control:</strong></b>&nbsp;SQL can be used to restrict a userâ€™s ability to retrieve, add, and modify data, protecting stored data against unauthorized access.</li>
     <li value="5"><b><strong>Data sharing: </strong></b>SQL is used to coordinate data sharing by concurrent users, ensuring that changes made by one user do not inadvertently wipe out changes made at nearly the same time by another user.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2 id="why-sql">Why SQL?</h2>
<ul>
<li value="1">SQL is an interactive question language.&nbsp;Users type SQL instructions into an interactive SQL software to retrieve facts and show them on the screen, presenting a convenient, easy-to-use device for ad hoc database queries.&nbsp;</li>
<li value="2">SQL is a database programming language.&nbsp;Programmers embed SQL instructions into their utility packages to access the facts in a database. Both user-written packages and database software packages (consisting of document writers and facts access tools) use this approach for database access.&nbsp;</li>
<li value="3">SQL is a client/server language.&nbsp;Personal computer programs use SQL to communicate over a network with database servers that save shared facts. This client/server architecture is utilized by many famous enterprise-class applications.</li>
<li value="4">&nbsp;SQL is Internet facts access language.&nbsp;Internet net servers that interact with company facts and Internet utility servers all use SQL as a widespread language for getting access to company databases, frequently through embedding SQL databases get entry to inside famous scripting languages like PHP or Perl.</li>
<li value="5">&nbsp;SQL is a distributed database language.&nbsp;Distributed database control structures use SQL to assist distribute facts throughout many linked pc structures. The DBMS software program on every gadget makes use of SQL to speak with the opposite structures, sending requests for facts to get entry to.&nbsp;</li>
<li value="6">SQL is a database gateway language.&nbsp;In a pc community with a mixture of various DBMS products, SQL is frequently utilized in a gateway&nbsp;that lets one logo of DBMS speak with every other logo. SQL has for this reason emerged as a useful, effective device for linking people, pc packages, and pc structures to the facts saved in a relational database.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
